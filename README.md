Html-something
==============
Html-something was an un-named school project
the idea was to give the people a tabletop simulator-like (game in steam)
experience on the internet in short, it was supposed to be a website
that houses varying board-games, for now and for ever the only
thing it will hosts is chess because i don't have the time to develop it
